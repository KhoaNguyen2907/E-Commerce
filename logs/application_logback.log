Description:

Field template in com.ckt.ecommercecybersoft.EcommerceCybersoftApplication required a single bean, but 2 were found:
	- redisTemplate: defined by method 'redisTemplate' in class path resource [org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/data/redis/RedisAutoConfiguration.class]
	- stringRedisTemplate: defined by method 'stringRedisTemplate' in class path resource [org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/data/redis/RedisAutoConfiguration.class]


Action:

Consider marking one of the beans as @Primary, updating the consumer to accept multiple beans, or using @Qualifier to identify the bean that should be consumed

Description:

Field template in com.ckt.ecommercecybersoft.EcommerceCybersoftApplication required a single bean, but 2 were found:
	- redisTemplate: defined by method 'redisTemplate' in class path resource [org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/data/redis/RedisAutoConfiguration.class]
	- stringRedisTemplate: defined by method 'stringRedisTemplate' in class path resource [org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/data/redis/RedisAutoConfiguration.class]


Action:

Consider marking one of the beans as @Primary, updating the consumer to accept multiple beans, or using @Qualifier to identify the bean that should be consumed

Description:

Field template in com.ckt.ecommercecybersoft.EcommerceCybersoftApplication required a single bean, but 2 were found:
	- redisTemplate: defined by method 'redisTemplate' in class path resource [org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/data/redis/RedisAutoConfiguration.class]
	- stringRedisTemplate: defined by method 'stringRedisTemplate' in class path resource [org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/data/redis/RedisAutoConfiguration.class]


Action:

Consider marking one of the beans as @Primary, updating the consumer to accept multiple beans, or using @Qualifier to identify the bean that should be consumed
